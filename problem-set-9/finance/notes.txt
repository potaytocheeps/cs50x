The following is the command used to create a table to keep track of users' stock
purchases. It enables me to keep track of who bought what, at what price, and when,
as outlined by the CS50's problem specification.

CREATE TABLE purchases (
    id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    stock_symbol TEXT NOT NULL,
    shares_amount INTEGER NOT NULL,
    stock_price NUMERIC NOT NULL,
    transaction_date TEXT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(id),
    FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
